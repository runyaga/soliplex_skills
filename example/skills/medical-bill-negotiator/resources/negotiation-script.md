# Phone Script: Negotiating Your Medical Bill

Use this word-for-word script when calling the billing department.

---

## Opening

> "Hello, my name is **[Your Name]** and I'm calling about a bill for my account, number **[Account Number]**. My date of service was **[Date]**."

> "I've reviewed my itemized bill and my Explanation of Benefits, and I have a few questions. I'm hoping you can help me resolve this."

---

## Present Your Leverage

Choose the approach that fits your situation:

### Approach A: Billing Error Found

> "I believe there may be an error on my bill. I was charged for **[Service Name]**, CPT code **[Code]**, but it appears to be a duplicate charge / I never received this service / the quantity is incorrect."

> "Can you please review this and issue a corrected bill?"

### Approach B: Price Too High (Fair Market Research)

> "I've researched the fair market price for **[Service Name]**, CPT code **[Code]**, in my area using FAIR Health Consumer. The typical cost is around **$[Fair Price]**, but I was billed **$[Your Bill]**. That's **[X]%** higher than the market rate."

> "I'd like to discuss adjusting this charge to be more in line with typical rates."

### Approach C: Financial Hardship / Prompt Pay

> "This bill is more than I can afford to pay at once. I'd like to discuss options. Do you offer:"
> - "A prompt-pay discount if I pay in full today?"
> - "A financial hardship program?"
> - "An interest-free payment plan?"

---

## Make Your Offer

> "Based on my research / the billing error / my financial situation, I can offer to pay **$[Your Offer]** to settle this bill in full today."

**Then be silent.** Let them respond. They will likely counter.

---

## If They Push Back

> "I understand. However, I've done my research and this amount is significantly above the fair market rate. What's the best you can do?"

> "Is there a supervisor I could speak with who has authority to adjust this?"

---

## If They Agree

> "That's great, thank you so much for working with me."

> "Before I make the payment, can you please send me **written confirmation** of the new agreed-upon balance of **$[Amount]** via email? Once I receive that, I'll process the payment immediately."

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT pay until you have this in writing!

---

## Closing

> "Thank you for your help today. Can I have your name and a reference number for this call?"

**Write down**:
- Representative name: _____________
- Date/time of call: _____________
- Reference number: _____________
- Agreed amount: _____________

## Tips for Success

1. **Be polite but firm** - Billing reps deal with angry people all day. Kindness goes far.
2. **Call early in the day** - Less hold time, fresher reps
3. **Have your documents ready** - Itemized bill, EOB, fair price research
4. **Take notes** - Document everything
5. **Be prepared to escalate** - Ask for supervisor if needed
6. **Don't accept "no" immediately** - Try again another day with different rep
