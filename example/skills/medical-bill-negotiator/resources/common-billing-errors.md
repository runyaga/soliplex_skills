# Common Medical Billing Errors

Use this checklist when auditing your itemized bill.

## High-Frequency Errors

### 1. Duplicate Billing
Charging for the same service, medication, or procedure more than once.

**Example**: Two charges for "IV administration" when you only had one IV.

### 2. Canceled Services
Billing for tests or procedures that were ordered but then canceled.

**Example**: Doctor ordered an MRI, then decided X-ray was sufficient, but MRI still appears on bill.

### 3. Upcoding
Inflating your diagnosis or procedure to a more expensive CPT code.

**Example**:
- Billed: 99215 (Complex office visit) - $250
- Actual: 99213 (Simple office visit) - $100

### 4. Unbundling
Billing separately for services that should be bundled into one CPT code.

**Example**: Charging separately for surgical prep, anesthesia setup, and recovery room when they should be included in the surgery code.

### 5. Incorrect Quantities
Wrong number of items billed.

**Example**: Billed for 30 tablets, but prescription was only 10.

### 6. Wrong Patient Information
Incorrect name, date of birth, or insurance policy number causing automatic denial.

### 7. Out-of-Network Surprise
Provider was out-of-network even though facility was in-network.

**Example**: In-network hospital, but the anesthesiologist was out-of-network.

## How to Dispute Errors
