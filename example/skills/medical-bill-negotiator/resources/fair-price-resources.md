# How to Research Fair Medical Prices

Your negotiation power comes from knowing what a service SHOULD cost.

## Step 1: Get Your CPT Codes

From your itemized bill, find the 5-digit CPT codes for each service.

**Example**:
- 99213 = Office visit, established patient, low complexity
- 99283 = Emergency department visit, moderate severity
- 27447 = Total knee replacement

### FAIR Health Consumer

The gold standard. Enter your CPT code and ZIP code to see:
- What insurance typically pays
- What you might pay out-of-pocket
- Range of prices in your area

### Healthcare Bluebook
**URL**: https://www.healthcarebluebook.com/

Shows "fair price" for common procedures. Good for surgeries and imaging.

### Medicare Fee Schedule
**URL**: https://www.cms.gov/medicare/physician-fee-schedule/search

What Medicare pays for services. Often used as baseline for negotiation.

**Tip**: Hospitals often accept 150-200% of Medicare rates as "fair".

## Step 3: Calculate Your Target Price

| Source | Your Service Price |
|--------|-------------------|
| FAIR Health (median) | $_____ |
| Healthcare Bluebook | $_____ |
| Medicare rate x 1.5 | $_____ |
| **Your target offer** | $_____ |

## What to Say

> "I researched the fair market price for CPT code [CODE] in my ZIP code using FAIR Health Consumer. The typical cost is around $[FAIR_PRICE], but I was billed $[BILLED]. That's [X]% higher than the market rate."

## Pro Tips

1. **Print your research** - Have it ready during the call
2. **Be specific** - Reference CPT codes, not just "the surgery"
3. **Compare to Medicare** - "Medicare pays $X for this, and I'm being charged 5x that"
4. **Ask about cash price** - Often 40-60% less than insurance-billed price
