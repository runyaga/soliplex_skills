# How to Negotiate Your Medical Bills

A structured methodology for auditing and negotiating medical bills. Following this process can significantly reduce your out-of-pocket costs.

## Why This Skill Exists

Most people receive a medical bill and just pay it. But medical bills are often:
- **Incorrect** - Billing errors are extremely common
- **Inflated** - Hospital "chargemaster" prices are 3-10x higher than fair market rates
- **Negotiable** - Providers regularly accept less than the billed amount

This skill teaches you to stop being a passive price-taker and become an informed negotiator.

## Methodology

### Step 1: Don't Pay Immediately
The first bill is often not final. Wait for the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) from your insurer to see what they covered.

### Step 2: Request an Itemized Bill
Call the provider's billing department and request a **detailed, itemized bill**. This lists every charge with specific CPT (Current Procedural Terminology) codes.

### Step 3: Audit for Errors
Review the itemized bill carefully. Look for:
- **Duplicate charges** - Billed twice for same service?
- **Incorrect quantities** - 5 pills billed, 1 received?
- **Upcoding** - CPT code for more expensive procedure than performed?
- **Services not rendered** - Charges for things that didn't happen?

### Step 4: Research the Fair Price
Use CPT codes to look up typical costs in your area. This data is your primary negotiation leverage.

See: `resources/fair-price-resources.md`

### Step 5: Make the Call
Contact the billing department. Be polite, firm, and prepared with your research.

See: `resources/negotiation-script.md`

### Step 6: Get It In Writing
Once you agree on a reduced amount, **do not pay** until you receive written confirmation of the new balance via email or mail.

## The "Aha Moment"

**Without this skill**: You receive a $3,000 bill and pay it, or ignore it and damage your credit.

**With this skill**: You discover you were double-charged for anesthesia, the CPT code was upcoded, and the fair market price is $1,200. You negotiate down to $900 and pay today.

**Savings: $2,100**
